                                              12-Bit Programmable Contactless
                                              Potentiometer

General Description                           The AS5600 is an easy to program magnetic rotary position
                                              sensor with a high-resolution 12-bit analog or PWM output. This
                                              contactless system measures the absolute angle of a diametric
                                              magnetized on-axis magnet. This AS5600 is designed for
                                              contactless potentiometer applications and its robust design
                                              eliminates the influence of any homogenous external stray
                                              magnetic fields.
                                              The industry-standard I²C interface supports simple user
                                              programming of non-volatile parameters without requiring a
                                              dedicated programmer.
                                              By default the output represents a range from 0 to 360 degrees.
                                              It is also possible to define a smaller range to the output by
                                              programming a zero angle (start position) and a maximum
                                              angle (stop position).
                                              The AS5600 is also equipped with a smart low power mode
                                              feature to automatically reduce the power consumption.
                                              An input pin (DIR) selects the polarity of the output with regard
                                              to rotation direction. If DIR is connected to ground, the output
                                              value increases with clockwise rotation. If DIR is connected to
                                              VDD, the output value increases with counterclockwise
                                              rotation.
                                              Ordering Information and Content Guide appear at end of
                                              datasheet.

AS5600 − Detailed Description



Detailed Description                           The AS5600 is a Hall-based rotary magnetic position sensor
                                               using planar sensors that convert the magnetic field
                                               component perpendicular to the surface of the chip into a
                                               voltage.
                                               The signals coming from the Hall sensors are first amplified and
                                               filtered before being converted by the analog-to-digital
                                               converter (ADC). The output of the ADC is processed by the
                                               hardwired CORDIC block (Coordinate Rotation Digital
                                               Computer) to compute the angle and magnitude of the
                                               magnetic field vector. The intensity of the magnetic field is used
                                               by the automatic gain control (AGC) to adjust the amplification
                                               level to compensate for temperature and magnetic field
                                               variations.
                                               The angle value provided by the CORDIC algorithm is used by
                                               the output stage. The user can choose between an analog
                                               output and a PWM-encoded digital output. The former provides
                                               an output voltage which represents the angle as a ratiometric
                                               linear absolute value. The latter provides a digital output which
                                               represents the angle as the pulse width.
                                               The AS5600 is programmed through an industry-standard I²C
                                               interface to write an on-chip non-volatile memory. This
                                               interface can be used to program a zero angle (start position)
                                               and a maximum angle (stop position) which maps the full
                                               resolution of the output to a subset of the entire 0 to 360 degree
                                               range.


                                               IC Power Management
                                               The AS5600 be powered from a 5.0V supply using the on-chip
                                               LDO regulator, or it can be powered directly from a 3.3V supply.
                                               The internal LDO is not intended to power other external ICs
                                               and needs a 1 μF capacitor to ground, as shown in Figure 13.
                                               In 3.3V operation, the VDD5V and VDD3V3 pins must be tied
                                               together. VDD is the voltage level present at the VDD5V pin.

                                           I²C Interface
                                           The AS5600 supports the 2-wire Fast-mode Plus I²C-slave
                                           protocol in device mode, in compliance with the NXP
                                           Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semiconductors)
                                           specification UM10204. A device that sends data onto the bus
                                           is a transmitter and a device receiving data is a receiver. The
                                           device that controls the message is called a master. The devices
                                           that are controlled by the master are called slaves. A master
                                           device generates the serial clock (SCL), controls the bus access,
                                           and generates the START and STOP conditions that control the
                                           bus. The AS5600 always operates as a slave on the I²C bus.
                                           Connections to the bus are made through the open-drain I/O
                                           lines SDA and the input SCL. Clock stretching is not included.
                                           The host MCU (master) initiates data transfers. The 7-bit slave
                                           address of the AS5600 is 0x36 (0110110 in binary).

                                           Supported Modes
                                              • Random/Sequential read
                                              • Byte/Page write
                                              • Automatic increment (ANGLE register)
                                              • Standard-mode
                                              • Fast-mode
                                              • Fast–mode plus

                                           The SDA signal is the bidirectional data line. The SCL signal is
                                           the clock generated by the I²C bus master to synchronize
                                           sampling data from SDA. The maximum SCL frequency is 1 MHz.
                                           Data is sampled on the rising edge of SCL.

1. In Fast-mode Plus, fall time is specified the same for both output stage and bus timing. If series resistors are used this has to be
   considered for bus timing.
2. Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes of less than 50 ns.
3. I/O pins of Fast-mode and Fast-mode Plus devices must not load or drive the SDA and SCL lines if VDD is switched OFF.
4. Special-purpose devices such as multiplexers and switches may exceed this capacitance because they connect multiple paths
   together.

Note(s):
1. After this time, the first clock is generated.
2. A device must internally provide a minimum hold time of 120 ns (Fast-mode Plus) for the SDA signal (referred to the V IHmin of SCL)
   to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
3. A Fast-mode device can be used in a standard-mode system, but the requirement tSU;DAT = 250 ns must be met. This is automatically
   if the device does not stretch the low phase of SCL. If such a device does stretch the low phase of SCL, it must drive the next data
   bit on SDA (t Rmax + tSU;DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns) before SCL is released.
4. In Fast-mode Plus, fall time is specified the same for both output stage and bus timing. If series resistors are used, this has to be
   considered for bus timing.

AS5600 − Detailed Description



                                I²C Modes

                                Invalid Addresses
                                There are two addresses used to access an AS5600 register. The
                                first is the slave address used to select the AS5600. All I²C bus
                                transactions include a slave address. The slave address of the
                                AS5600 is 0x36 (0110110 in binary) The second address is a word
                                address sent in the first byte transferred in a write transaction.
                                The word address selects a register on the AS5600. The word
                                address is loaded into the address pointer on the AS5600.
                                During subsequent read transactions and subsequent bytes in
                                the write transaction, the address pointer provides the address
                                of the selected register. The address pointer is incremented
                                after each byte is transferred, except for certain read
                                transactions to special registers.
                                If the user sets the address pointer to an invalid word address,
                                the address byte is not acknowledged (the A bit is high).
                                Nevertheless, a read or write cycle is possible. The address
                                pointer is increased after each byte.

                                Reading
                                When reading from an invalid address, the AS5600 returns all
                                zeros in the data bytes. The address pointer is incremented after
                                each byte. Sequential reads over the whole address range are
                                possible including address overflow.

                                Automatic Increment of the Address Pointer for ANGLE,
                                RAW ANGLE and MAGNITUDE Registers
                                These are special registers which suppress the automatic
                                increment of the address pointer on reads, so a re-read of these
                                registers requires no I²C write command to reload the address
                                pointer. This special treatment of the pointer is effective only if
                                the address pointer is set to the high byte of the register.

                                Writing
                                A write to an invalid address is not acknowledged by the
                                AS5600, although the address pointer is incremented. When the
                                address pointer points to a valid address again, a successful
                                write accessed is acknowledged. Page write over the whole
                                address range is possible including address overflow.

                                Supported Bus Protocol
                                Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                                During data transfer, the data line must remain stable whenever
                                SCL is high. Changes in the data line while SCL is high are
                                interpreted as START or STOP conditions.

                                                    Accordingly, the following bus conditions have been defined:
                                                    Bus Not Busy
                                                    Both SDA and SCL remain high.
                                                    Start Data Transfer
                                                    A change in the state of SDA from high to low while SCL is high
                                                    defines the START condition.
                                                    Stop Data Transfer
                                                    A change in the state of SDA from low to high while SCL is high
                                                    defines the STOP condition.
                                                    Data Valid
                                                    The state of the data line represents valid data when, after a
                                                    START condition, SDA is stable for the duration of the high
                                                    phase of SCL. The data on SDA must be changed during the low
                                                    phase of SCL. There is one clock period per bit of data.
                                                    Each I²C bus transaction is initiated with a START condition and
                                                    terminated with a STOP condition. The number of data bytes
                                                    transferred between START and STOP conditions is not limited,
                                                    and is determined by the I²C bus master. The information is
                                                    transferred byte-wise and each receiver acknowledges with a
                                                    ninth bit.
                                                    Acknowledge
                                                    Each I²C slave device, when addressed, is obliged to generate
                                                    an acknowledge after the reception of each byte. The I²C bus
                                                    master device must generate an extra clock period for this
                                                    acknowledge bit.
                                                    A slave that acknowledges must pull down SDA during the
                                                    acknowledge clock period in such a way that SDA is stable low
                                                    during the high phase of the acknowledge clock period. Of
                                                    course, setup and hold times must be taken into account. A
                                                    master must signal an end of a read transaction by not
                                                    generating an acknowledge bit on the last byte that has been
                                                    clocked out of the slave. In this case, the slave must leave SDA
                                                    high to enable the master to generate the STOP condition.

AS5600 − Detailed Description



                                Depending on the state of the R/W bit, two types of data transfer
                                are possible:
                                Data Transfer from a Master Transmitter to a Slave Receiver
                                The first byte transmitted by the master is the slave address,
                                followed by R/W = 0. Next follows a number of data bytes. The
                                slave returns an acknowledge bit after each received byte. If the
                                slave does not understand the command or data it sends a not
                                acknowledge (NACK). Data is transferred with the most
                                significant bit (MSB) first.
                                Data Transfer from a Slave Transmitter to a Master Receiver
                                The master transmits the first byte (the slave address). The slave
                                then returns an acknowledge bit, followed by the slave
                                transmitting a number of data bytes. The master returns an
                                acknowledge bit after all received bytes other than the last byte.
                                At the end of the last received byte, a NACK is returned. The
                                master generates all of the SCL clock periods and the START and
                                STOP conditions. A transfer is ended with a STOP condition or
                                with a repeated START condition. Because a repeated START
                                condition is also the beginning of the next serial transfer, the
                                bus is not released. Data is transferred with the most significant

                                Slave Receiver Mode (Write Mode)
                                Serial data and clock are received through SDA and SCL. Each
                                byte is followed by an acknowledge bit or by a not acknowledge
                                depending on whether the address-pointer selects a valid
                                address. START and STOP conditions are recognized as the
                                beginning and end of a bus transaction. The slave address byte
                                is the first byte received after the START condition. The 7-bit
                                AS5600 address is 0x36 (0110110 in binary).
                                The 7-bit slave address is followed by the direction bit (R/W),
                                which, for a write, is 0 (low). After receiving and decoding the
                                slave address byte the slave device drives an acknowledge on
                                SDA. After the AS5600 acknowledges the slave address and
                                write bit, the master transmits a register address (word address)
                                to the AS5600. This is loaded into the address pointer on the
                                AS5600. If the address is a valid readable address, the AS5600
                                answers by sending an acknowledge (A bit low). If the address
                                pointer selects an invalid address, a not acknowledge is sent (A
                                bit high). The master may then transmit zero or more bytes of
                                data. If the address pointer selects an invalid address, the
                                received data are not stored. The address pointer will increment
                                after each byte transferred whether or not the address is valid.
                                If the address-pointer reaches a valid position again, the
                                AS5600 answers with an acknowledge and stores the data. The
                                master generates a STOP condition to terminate the write
                                transaction.

                                                             mode. However, in this mode, the direction bit indicates that
                                                             the AS5600 will drive data on SDA. START and STOP conditions

                                                             the 7-bit AS5600 address. The 7-bit slave address is followed by
                                                             the direction bit (R/W), which, for a read, is 1 (high). After

                                                             must receive a not acknowledge (NACK) to end a read

Register Description                                   The following registers are accessible over the serial I²C
                                                       interface. The 7-bit device address of the slave is 0x36

                                                   The CONF register supports customizing the AS5600. Figure 22

                           STATUS Register
                           The STATUS register provides bits that indicate the current state
                           of the AS5600.

Figure 23:
STATUS Register


            Name                          State When Bit Is High

              MH    AGC minimum gain overflow, magnet too strong

              ML    AGC maximum gain overflow, magnet too weak

              MD    Magnet was detected


                           AGC Register
                           The AS5600 uses Automatic Gain Control in a closed loop to
                           compensate for variations of the magnetic field strength due
                           to changes of temperature, airgap between IC and magnet, and
                           magnet degradation. The AGC register indicates the gain. For
                           the most robust performance, the gain value should be in the
                           center of its range. The airgap of the physical system can be
                           adjusted to achieve this value.
                           In 5V operation, the AGC range is 0-255 counts. The AGC range
                           is reduced to 0-128 counts in 3.3V mode.


                           MAGNITUDE Register
                           The MAGNITUDE register indicates the magnitude value of the
                           internal CORDIC.


                           Non-Volatile Memory (OTP)
                           The non-volatile memory is used to permanently program the
                           configuration. To program the non-volatile memory, the I²C
                           interface is used (Option A, Option C). Alternatively, start and
                           stop positions can be programmed through the output pin
                           (Option B). The programming can be either performed in the
                           5V supply mode or in the 3.3V operation mode but using a
                           minimum supply voltage of 3.3V and a 10 μF capacitor at the
                           VDD3V3 pin to ground. This 10 μF capacitor is needed only
                           during the programming of the device. Two different
                           commands are used to permanently program the device:

                                Burn_Angle Command (ZPOS, MPOS)
                                The host microcontroller can perform a permanent
                                programming of ZPOS and MPOS with a BURN_ANGLE
                                command. To perform a BURN_ANGLE command, write the
                                value 0x80 into register 0xFF. The BURN_ANGLE command can
                                be executed up to 3 times. ZMCO shows how many times ZPOS
                                and MPOS have been permanently written.
                                This command may only be executed if the presence of the
                                magnet is detected (MD = 1).

                                Burn_Setting Command (MANG, CONFIG)
                                The host microcontroller can perform a permanent writing of
                                MANG and CONFIG with a BURN_SETTING command. To
                                perform a BURN_SETTING command, write the value 0x40 into
                                register 0xFF.
                                MANG can be written only if ZPOS and MPOS have never been
                                permanently written (ZMCO = 00). The BURN_ SETTING
                                command can be performed only one time.


                                Angle Programming
                                For applications which do not use the full 0 to 360 degree
                                angular range, the output resolution can be enhanced by
                                programming the range which is actually used. In this case, the
                                full resolution of the output is automatically scaled to the
                                programmed angular range. The angular range must be greater
                                than 18 degrees.
                                The range is specified by programming a start position (ZPOS)
                                and either a stop position (MPOS) or the size of the angular
                                range (MANG).
                                The BURN_ANGLE command can be executed up to 3 times.

                                                        There are three recommended methods for programming the
                                                        angular range:
                                                            • Option A: Angle Programming Through the I²C Interface
                                                            • Option B: Angle Programming Through the OUT Pin
                                                            • Option C: Programming a Maximum Angular Range
                                                              Through the I²C Interface

Figure 24:
Option A: Angle Programming Through the I²C Interface


 Use the correct hardware configuration shown in Figure 37 and Figure 38.

    Step 1       Power up the AS5600.

    Step 2       Turn the magnet to the start position.

                 Read the RAW ANGLE register.
    Step 3       Write the RAW ANGLE value into the ZPOS register.
                 Wait at least 1 ms.

                 Rotate the magnet in the direction defined by the level on the DIR pin (GND for clockwise, VDD
    Step 4       for counterclockwise) to the stop position. The amount of rotation must be greater than
                 18 degrees.

                 Read the RAW ANGLE register.
    Step 5       Write the RAW ANGLE value into the MPOS register.
                 Wait at least 1 ms.

 Proceed with Step 6 to permanently program the configuration.

                 Perform a BURN_ANGLE command to permanently program the device.
    Step 6
                 Wait at least 1 ms.

                 Verify the BURN_ANGLE command:
                 Write the commands 0x01, 0x11 and 0x10 sequentially into the register 0xFF to load the actual
    Step 7
                 OTP content.
                 Read the ZPOS and MPOS registers to verify that the BURN_ANGLE command was successful.

    Step 8       Read and verify the ZPOS and MPOS registers again after a new power-up cycle.


Note(s):
1. After each register command, the new setting is effective at the output at least 1 ms later.
2. It is highly recommended to perform a functional test after this procedure.

AS5600 − Register Description



Figure 25:
Option B: Angle Programming Through the OUT Pin


 Use the correct hardware configuration shown in Figure 37 and Figure 38. The PGO pin is connected to GND
 and the OUT pin is pulled high by an internal resistor until the programming procedure is finished.

   Step 1        Power up the AS5600.

   Step 2        Position the magnet in the start position.

   Step 3        Pull the OUT pin to GND for at least 100 ms, then allow the pin to float.

                 Rotate the magnet in the same direction defined by the level on the DIR pin (GND for clockwise,
   Step 4        VDD for counterclockwise) to the stop position. The amount of rotation must be greater than
                 18 degrees.

   Step 5        Pull the OUT pin to GND for at least 100 ms, then allow the pin to float.

                 Check if the OUT pin is permanently driven to GND. This indicates an error occurred during
   Step 6        programming. If the voltage driven on the OUT pin corresponds to the magnet position, the
                 procedure was performed successfully.


Note(s):
1. After step 5 the new setting is effective at the output.
2. If step 3 is not followed by step 5 no permanent write will be performed.
3. It is highly recommended to perform a functional test after the procedure.
4. This procedure can be executed only one time; the zero position and maximum angle can be reprogrammed only through the I²C
   (Option A).
5. This procedure can be executed only if the presence of the magnet is detected (MD = 1).

Figure 26:
Option C: Programming a Maximum Angular Range Through the I²C Interface


 Use the correct hardware configuration shown in Figure 37 and Figure 38.

   Step 1      Power up the AS5600.

               Use the I²C interface to write the maximum angular range into the MANG register. For example, if
               the maximum angular range is 90 degrees, write the MANG register with 0x400.
   Step 2
               Configure additional configuration settings by writing the CONFIG register.
               Wait at least 1 ms.

 Proceed with Step 3 to permanently program the configuration.

               Perform a BURN_SETTINGS command to permanently program the device.
   Step 3
               Wait at least 1 ms.

               Verify the BURN_SETTINGS command:
               Write the commands 0x01, 0x11 and 0x10 sequentially into the register 0xFF to load the actual OTP
   Step 4      content.
               Read and verify the MANG and CONF registers to verify that the BURN_SETTINGS command was
               successful.

 Proceed with Step 5 to permanently program a zero position. If the OUT pin is used for this option, the PGO pin
 must be connected to GND.

   Step 5      Position the magnet in the start position (zero angle).

               Pull the OUT pin to GND for at least 100 ms, then allow the pin to float. Alternatively, program the
   Step 6      zero position through the I²C interface (Option A).
               Wait at least 1 ms.

               Verify the permanent programming by I²C (Option A) or check if OUT is permanently driven to GND
   Step 7
               (Option B).

   Step 8      Read and verify the permanently programmed registers again after a new power-up cycle.


Note(s):
1. After each register command, the new configuration is effective at the output at least 1 ms later.
2. It is recommended to perform a functional test after this procedure.

AS5600 − Register Description



                                                   Analog Output Mode
                                                   By default, the AS5600 output stage is configured as analog
                                                   ratiometric output. The Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) has
                                                   12-bit resolution. In default mode, the lower reference voltage
                                                   for the DAC is GND, while the upper reference voltage is VDD.
                                                   The output voltage on the OUT pin is ratiometric between GND
                                                   and VDD.
                                                   The maximum angular range can be programmed from
                                                   18 degrees to 360 degrees. The default range is 360 degrees.
                                                   As shown below, if the range is 360 degrees, to avoid
                                                   discontinuity points exactly at the limit of the range, a 10-LSB
                                                   hysteresis is applied. This hysteresis suppresses toggling the
                                                   OUT pin when the magnet is close to zero or 360 degrees.

                                                   as the maximum angular range. As shown in Figure 28, reducing
                                                   the maximum angular range pushes the non-discontinuity

                                                   the maximum angle) by λ, where λ= (360 - θ max)/2.

AS5600 − Register Description



                                        PWM Output Mode
                                       The AS5600 output stage can be programmed in the OUTS bits
                                       of the CONF register for a PWM-encoded digital output (OUTS
                                       = 10). In this mode, the OUT pin provides a digital PWM signal.
                                       The duty cycle of each pulse is proportional to the absolute
                                       angle of the rotating magnet.
                                       The PWM signal consists of a frame of 4351 PWM clock periods
                                       as shown in Figure 30. This PWM frame is composed of the
                                       following sections:
                                          • 128 PWM clock periods high
                                          • 4095 PWM clock periods data
                                          • 128 PWM clock periods low

                                       The angle is represented in the data part of the frame, and one
                                       PWM clock period represents one 4096 th of the full angular
                                       range. The PWM frequency is programmed with the PWMF bits
                                       in the CONF register.

                                     Step Response and Filter Settings
                                     The AS5600 has a digital post-processing programmable filter
                                     which can be set in fast or slow modes. The fast filter mode can
                                     be enabled by setting a fast filter threshold in the FTH bits of
                                     the CONF register.
                                     If the fast filter is OFF, the step output response is controlled by
                                     the slow linear filter. The step response of the slow filter is
                                     programmable with the SF bits in the CONF register. Figure 32
                                     shows the tradeoff between delay and noise for the different
                                     SF bit settings.

AS5600 − Register Description



                                For a fast step response and low noise after settling, the fast
                                filter can be enabled. The fast filter works only if the input
                                variation is greater than the fast filter threshold, otherwise the
                                output response is determined only by the slow filter. The fast
                                filter threshold is programmed with the FTH bits in the CONF
                                Register. As shown in Figure 34, the step response stays within

AS5600 − Register Description



                                               Hysteresis
                                               To avoid any toggling of the output when the magnet is not
                                               moving, a 1 to 3 LSB hysteresis of the 12-bit resolution can be
                                               enabled with the HYST bits in the CONF register.


                                               Magnet Detection
                                               As a safety and diagnostic feature, the AS5600 indicates the
                                               absence of the magnet. If the measured magnet field strength
                                               goes below the minimum specified level (Bz_ERROR), the
                                               output is driven low, without regard to which output mode has
                                               been selected (analog or PWM) and the MD bit in the STATUS
                                               register is 0.


                                               Low Power Modes
                                               A digital state machine automatically manages the low power
                                               modes to reduce the average current consumption. Three low
                                               power modes are available and can be enabled with the PM bits
                                               in the CONF register. Current consumption and polling times
                                               are shown in Figure 6.


                                               Watchdog Timer
                                               The watchdog timer allows saving power by switching into
                                               LMP3 if the angle stays within the watchdog threshold of 4 LSB
                                               for at least one minute, as shown in Figure 36. The watchdog
                                               function can be enabled with the WD bit in the CONF register.

                                                      Magnetic Requirements
                                                      The AS5600 requires the magnetic field component Bz
                                                      perpendicular to the sensitive area on the chip.
                                                      Along the circumference of the Hall element circle the magnetic
                                                      field Bz should be sine-shaped. The magnetic field gradient of
                                                      Bz along the radius of the circle should be in the linear range
                                                      of the magnet to eliminate displacement error by the
                                                      differential measurement principle.

Magnetic Field Bz and Typical Airgap




                                                                                      N           S
                                                                                                                         0.5 – 3 mm typ.




                                                      The typical airgap is between 0.5 mm and 3 mm, and it depends
                                                      on the selected magnet. A larger and stronger magnet allows a
                                                      larger airgap. Using the AGC value as a guide, the optimal airgap
                                                      can be found by adjusting the distance between the magnet
                                                      and the AS5600 so that the AGC value is in the center of its
                                                      range. The maximum allowed displacement of the rotational
                                                      axis of the reference magnet from the center of the package is
                                                      0.25 mm when using a magnet with a diameter of 6mm.

RoHS Compliant & ams Green   RoHS: The term RoHS compliant means that ams AG products
                             fully comply with current RoHS directives. Our semiconductor
Statement
                             products do not contain any chemicals for all 6 substance
                             categories, including the requirement that lead not exceed
                             0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to
                             be soldered at high temperatures, RoHS compliant products are
                             suitable for use in specified lead-free processes.
                             ams Green (RoHS compliant and no Sb/Br): ams Green
                             defines that in addition to RoHS compliance, our products are
                             free of Bromine (Br) and Antimony (Sb) based flame retardants
                             (Br or Sb do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous
                             material).

                             information. Efforts are underway to better integrate
                             information from third parties. ams AG has taken and continues
